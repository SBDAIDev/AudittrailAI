Continue the spray test until all the\nsolution flow from each gun is uniform. Stop the\nspray test, remove the polybag and discard.\n6.3.1.5.7 Use tared sample polybags for weighing the\ncoating solution for verification of the spray rate.\nHold the sample polybag at each spray gun.\n6.3.1.5.8 Start Spray test, the solution shall start flowing\nthrough each spray gun without atomization.\nCollect the coating solution in each tared polybag\nfor one-minute. Weigh individual spray solutions\nfrom each gun. Stop the spray test, calculate and\nrecord the average spray rate in “Coating\nMonitoring Record of Tablets” attached in BPCR.\n6.3.1.5.9 Increase or decrease the peristaltic pumps RPM to\nincrease or decrease the spray rate.\n6.3.1.5.10If required perform the spray rate again for uniform\nspray rate.\n6.3.1.5.11Discard the polybags and solution.\n6.3.1.6\nSpray Pattern Setting:\n6.3.1.6.1 Verify the spray pattern by setting atomization\npressure as per the Batch Production and Control\nRecord. Set the gun-to-gun distance for effective\nspray pattern. Set the optimum spray pattern by\nrotating the Atomization Air Fan setting knob\n“Clockwise or Anticlockwise” or set pattern air on\nIPC as applicable. Hold the stainless-steel tray in\nfront of the guns, keeping the distance between\ntray and gun similar to the distance between gun\nand bed. Start “Spray Test” and verify the spray\npattern on the SS tray. The spray pattern shall be\nuniform and shall not overlap with other guns\nspray pattern.\n6.3.1.6.2 If required perform the spray pattern again for\noptimum spray pattern.\n6.3.1.6.3 Stop the “Spray Test”.\n6.3.1.6.4 Record the spray pattern verification whether it is\nOK or NOT OK in Coating Monitoring Record of\nTablets (MYCOMP-SOP-QA-GMP-0049\nAttachment 7.12).”\n6.3.1.6.5 Remove the quick air release connectors of\ncontrolled air and atomization air.\n6.3.1.7 Take in the gun arm assembly, fix the quick air release\nconnectors of controlled air and atomization air.\n6.3.1.8 Before start the coating machine, set the DP pan -50 to 0,\nAir flow in between 2000 to 3500 CFM and spray pump rpm as\nper required spray rate or as per mentioned in respective\nBPCR.\n6.3.1.9 Press Start option to start the coating process.\n6.3.1.10 Press the “Status option” to view the online status of\nScrubber Pump/Spray Pump, Exhaust Blower, Inlet Blower,\nHeater, Pan, and Atomizing Air.\n6.3.1.11 Refer the “Parameter” screen to monitor and record the\noperation parameters at the intervals mentioned in the\nBPCR.\n6.3.1.12 Following procedure shall be followed for coating machine\nstoppage during operation:\n6.3.1.12.1Stop the spray by stopping peristaltic pump.\n6.3.1.12.2Stop the machine by pressing stop key and take\nout the spray gun arm assembly.\n6.3.1.12.3Keep the coating pan in inching mode.\n6.3.1.12.4This procedure shall be followed during each\nbreaks and interruptions. The details of\ninterruptions shall be recorded in BPCR.\n6.3.1.12.5To restart the coating process, set the inlet\ntemperature and Pan RPM to previous set value\nor as required as per Batch Production and\nControl Record. Press the auto start button. Once\nthe exhaust temperature is achieved, spraying will\nstart automatically at set spray rate.\n6.3.1.13 Always collect sample through sampling port by sampling\nspatula.\n6.3.1.14 Stop the spray when percentage weight gain is achieved as\nper Batch Production Control Record. Set the spraying cycle\nvalue to the current value. Post jog cycle will start\nautomatically and dry the coated tablets for the specified\ntime and parameters as per the Batch Production Control\nRecord and then cool the tablets as specified in the Batch\nProduction Control Record. Check the percentage weight\ngain and record the same in Batch Production Control\nRecord.\n6.3.1.15 Check the Physical parameter of coated tablets as per\ndescription of Batch Production and Control Record.\n6.3.1.16 Disconnect the quick release couplings of atomization air\nand controlled air.\n6.3.1.17 Take out the spray arm assembly.\n6.3.1.18 To unload the tablet, connect the discharge chute assembly,\npress Discharge Option on IPC and unload the tablets in the\nduly labeled (Status label manufacturing-coated, MYCOMP-\nSOPOSDGEN-0023 Attachment 7.19 or MYCOMP-SOPOSD\nGEN-0023 Attachment 7.20) double poly bag lined container\nor as specified in the BPCR or if required unload the tablets\nmanually with the help of SS bowl.
